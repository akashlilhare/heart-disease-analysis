## Predicting heart disease in a patient using machine learning.

This notebook looks into using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart diesase based on their medical attributes.

### Proble Defenation :

> **Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have disease?**

### Data source :

The original data came from the cleavland data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci

### Sample data :

### Corelation of data:

### We've tried different machine learning model for prediction :

1. Logistic Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbours classifier
3. Random Forest classifier

#### Accuracy Scores of different models :


* Logistic Regression: 0.89
* KNM: 0.69
* Random Forest : 0.84
