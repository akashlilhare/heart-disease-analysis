## Predicting heart disease in a patient using machine learning.

This notebook looks into using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart diesase based on their medical attributes.

### Proble Defenation :

**Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have disease?**

### Data source :

The original data came from the cleavland data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci
